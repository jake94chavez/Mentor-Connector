# Mentor Connector
***
## Proposal

### The App
The objective of this app is to create a platform where younger people, Mentees, can look for career and life guides, Mentors. Our team has people that when they were younger, felt as if they weren't getting the education they wanted to and didn't have the resources to pursue the subjects they were passionate about. With Mentor Connector, we want to give younger people the opportunity to find a Mentor that can hand down the knowledge they've learned, and instill passion into the Mentees.
